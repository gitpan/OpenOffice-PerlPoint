.This is a first document. It starts with a text paragraph that contains so
many words that it occupies several lines. This makes it possible to see the
transformation effect in an exported format. Well, at least this is our
intention.

=A headline

.\U<And> \I<t>\B<\I<e>>\I<xt> \B<a>\B<\I<g>>\B<ain>.

.List:

*   \B<B\I<u>\I<\U<l>>let 1>

*   \I<Bul>\B<\I<l>>\I<et 2>

*   \U<Bullet 3>

==Sublevel-Chapter

.\F{color="#0000ff"}<List 2:>

#   \F{color="#ff0000"}<P 1>

#   P 2

#   \B<\I<\U<P>>> 3

.Now for some code, both \C<inline> and in a separate section.

       This stands for \I<code in an own paragraph>.
       It needs to be assigned to a named style ?Code?.
       Continued ?code?.

       We are still in the example,
       there was just a newline.

       Real code: 3\>5 ? 10 : \\\$var;

.Usual font again.

INTRO

This distribution provides a module OpenOffice::PerlPoint to transform
OpenOffice documents (and OASIS OpenDocument documents in general)
into the PerlPoint format, and a script oo2pp that makes
such conversion simple.

Note: THIS IS ALPHA STATE SOFTWARE.



INSTALLATION

To run this package successfully a beta version of OpenOffice::OODoc
(2.001 or better) is required. Please refer to the OODoc mailing list
for where to get it.


As usual, unpack the distribution file and call

 make test install distclean

After that, you should be able to call oo2pp directly.

 oo2pp

Please use option -help to display a short usage message. 


DOCUMENTATION

Documentation is provided both with the module and the script
- inline and in POD format.



SUPPPORT

A PerlPoint mailing list is set up to discuss usage, ideas,
bugs, suggestions and translator development. To subscribe,
please send an empty message to perlpoint-subscribe@perl.org.

If you prefer, you can contact me via perl@jochen-stenzel.de
as well.



CREDITS

Thanks to Jean-Marie Gouarné for OpenOffice::OODoc which allows

well documented framework.

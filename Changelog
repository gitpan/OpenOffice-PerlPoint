Added Text::Wrapper to the list of prerequisites (detected by CPAN testers, thanks).

The meta data prolog is template driven now, thus allowing individual results.

Reactivated $docDate as now with the template approach it can be excluded from tests.

New constructor option to suppress meta data handling completely.

User defined document data keys now configured via constructor option.

oo2pp() starts result with two newlines now, to guarantee correct detection of the first paragraph.

New constructor option: "imagebufferdir" allows to set up a user defined name for the image
buffer directory, which can be relative or absolute.

Added handling of external images.

Bugfix: $docDate value was title, not date.
	
Checking if an image URL host is available befoe trying to load an external image,
via Net::Ping.

New user defined field support "authormail".

Deactivated $docDate setting as it is difficult to handle with changing locales, suspended
till all the variables can be set by options.
